# Hello and welcome to my github! 

This is mostly a collection of collaborative class projects I have worked on at NYU including database design, unity game projects, and gamemaker projects.
Due to some of the absurd security surrounding NYU I wouldn't be suprised if some of these, especially those database design projects, are unavalible for view.

Enjoy looking through my code!
